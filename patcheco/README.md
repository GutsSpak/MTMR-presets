![Info]

I've added all my custom compiled tools in the scrips folder: 
- SMC tool that supports setting a custom fan speed for silicon macbooks (custom build based on this repo https://github.com/hholtmann/smcFanControl)
- temp_sensor2 that shows all temperature sensors every 5 seconds (custom build based on this repo https://github.com/fermion-star/apple_sensors)
